fix hook_AttackHitCheck firing when blocking incorrectly
add filtering to hook_SpriteUpdate, Krack was getting object values in there. Use 0xA80 for p1, 0x3F8 for p2. (test!)
Look into adding a thread that detects game/match state changes, potentially to replace roundTransition w/greater accuracy.
find more values lol
decode the drive state vars
