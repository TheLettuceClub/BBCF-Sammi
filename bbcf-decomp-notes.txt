known offsets for BATTLE_CObjectManager
9d4 = health (done)
5ad4 = heat
5ae4 = OD gauge
5b04 = barrier
2010c = drive??
20108 = max drive???
1338 = sprite string
2014 = current action string
1ff4 = previous action string
1a0 = "burning heart" (bang thing)


Stuff Pan said 2/1:
an attacks ability to fatal counter can be tested by doing (field & 0x800) != 0, and the field offset is 0x4A0
offset 0x191720 is what you want to hook for CreateObject events

also, im not sure what else you need right now, but if you want a good way to find stuff, you should investigate the scripts to see if theres any instructions you want to hook, then find those in the script memory (usually by jumping to a text result for a specific sprite or whatever) and then breakpointing on the instruction
you can get the scripts with this tool i wrote here, it has parsers for BBCFs archive format

look at stuff that writes to health values for onHit funcs

bbcf.exe+0x182655 is a func that runs once per char per frame
also +0x2997a7 (twice per visual frame update)
	once is esi=0, second is esi=1

+0x18C3C0 is generalized hit/block point
	eax is ptr to attacker?
	esi is ptr to defender?
	also works for projectiles, where attacker will be ptr to it's BCOM
	
+0x2126f6 runs immediately after character select is done, solid for round init

for round end, just check for someone having no health and CmnActRoundWin or similar
